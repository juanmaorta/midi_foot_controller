Although it is already working, we may add:

 - keep the command status (ie: recording). To this, we need to implement some kind of surface control
 - the command can be received from the DAW, and the controller updated accordingly (see surface control again)
 - we may add an OLED display to reflect the status
 - we may set the leds to blink when doing some actions
